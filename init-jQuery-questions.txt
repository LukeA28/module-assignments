jQuery Initial Questions:
1. Of course it is useful to familiarize myself with all traversal and manipulation methods, 
but are there some(ex. <div>, <body>, <a>, etc. tags in html) methods that I should start becoming 
extra familiar with?

2. If the answer to question number one is that the methods taught in the course modules will fall under 
that category, then are there a select few out of those that will be more important?

3. Are there external resources while writing jQuery scripts that help to organize exactly what will 
happen to the affected html file under certain circumstances(like a tree of effects)?

4. Will there be some scripts that contain pure javaScript from here on out or is it suggested to 
include jQuery objects and their methods in all scripts now that the material has been covered?

5. Is there a universally appreciated way of naming jQuery objects(or other components), compared to 
vanilla-based objects, that will help distinguish the difference between the two?
